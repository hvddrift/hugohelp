Hi Greg,

Thank you for your email.

The markings shown are to be expected; in all fairness, more will appear with use and time. It is a cooking appliance, so food, oil, and splatter can always cause a change to the burner surface's appearance - This is not unique; GAGGANAU - VZUG - MIELE and many other brands use the same suppliers as PITT do for burner components.

Unfortunately, PITT is a more beautiful appliance than most, and the tendency to over analyse the product is likely - But general maintenance and care will ensure it looks as good as possible throughout its life.

I have attached some reference photos of burners that are eight going on nine years old to indicate what the system may look like in time.

Kind regards,
Henry Gilpin
