- [ ] **Is the material of the worktop suitable?**

{{% notice style="note" %}}
**MATERIALS** USED FOR INSTALLATION MUST BE HEAT RESISTANCE AND BE RESISTANT TO HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE FOLLOWING
WORKTOP MATERIALS ARE ALLOWED TO USE IN COMBINATION WITH PITT® COOKING:
- Quartz composite (eg. Caesarstone, Silestone, Quantum Quartz, Smartstone)
- Natural stone (eg. granite, marble)
- Glass
- Concrete
- Compact panel
- Ceramics (eg. Dekton, Neolith, Maximim)
- Terrazzo
- Stainless steel (eg. 4 mm solid or 1(+) mm on substrate board **

- [ ] **Does the original thickness of the worktop fit the requirements?**
- [ ] **Is the required minimum C-size being applied?**
{{% notice style="note" %}}
The minimum thickness of the core material is 4 mm.
For Quartz composite, compact board and natural stone applies a minimum thickness of the core material (solid) of **10 mm**.
For Top Side for all materials, a maximum thickness of 35 mm applies.
For Front Side for all materials, a maximum thickness of 25 mm applies.

- [ ] **Does the PITT unit fit according to the depth of the worktop?**
- [ ] **Does the minimum required C-size fit into the design?** (Consider factors like grip rails, cabinet/front constructions.)
- [ ] **Is the distance from side to first cut-out at least 150 mm on both sides?**
- [ ] **Does the entire width of the PITT unit fit into the width of the cabinet?**
- [ ] **Can the PITT unit be freely disassembled without disassembling the cabinets/worktop?**
