Rest assured, with careful attention and the right method, the installation is straightforward and will ensure your control knob functions flawlessly.

## Installation Method:

1. Insert the control knob and scale (do not remove the adhesive yet.)

2. While adjusting the front adjustment screws from beneath the bench using a hand screwdriver, continuously monitor the control knob. Tighten the screws until the base of the control knob surpasses the top of the scale.

3. Detach both the scale and the control knob, then peel off the backing from the adhesive sticker.

4. Now, gently lower the scale back onto the benchtop, ensuring it's as centred as possible within the knob. Remember, it's a circle within a circle, alignment is key.

5. Press down on the control knob and rotate it counter clockwise until it reaches the 9 o'clock position. Ensure it springs back up to its initial position effortlessly.

6. Turn the knob from here to the 7 o'clock to 11 and back. This is helping the scale and knob align correctly. IMPORTANT. The only time the control knob should be pressed down in use is at the 9 0'clock position

7. Press the scale down to make full contact.
