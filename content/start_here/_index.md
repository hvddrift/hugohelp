## 4. Installation Procedure: An Innovative Methodology

The Pitt cooking system adopts a pioneering installation technique, distinguishing it from traditional methods. Detailed below is an elucidative overview of our signature approach and the inherent advantages it bestows.

### Under-the-Bench Installation:

1. **Preliminary Overview**: Before initiating the installation, ensure the under-bench area is accessible, devoid of obstructions, and prepped for the procedure.

2. **Positioning**: Instead of the customary drop-in from the top, the Pitt system is maneuvered from underneath the bench. This atypical methodology is delineated in the accompanying GIF.

3. **Design Considerations**: Given the under-the-bench installation, it's paramount that the design allocates adequate space for all Pitt components. This ensures an unhampered access during installation and maintenance.

4. **Advantages**:
    - **Aesthetic Superiority**: The absence of top-drop ensures a seamless integration with the countertop, enhancing the visual appeal.
    - **Ease of Installation**: By working from underneath, the installation is streamlined, reducing potential surface damage.
    - **Maintenance Accessibility**: Post-installation maintenance becomes more manageable due to the unhindered access to components from below.
