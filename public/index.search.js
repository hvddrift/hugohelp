    "content": "Partition Fabrication for PITT Cooktops Overview:\nIntegrating a PITT cooktop over an oven or within a partition for a drawer set requires careful planning and design.\nTip\rA disclaimer Terminology Clarification: The terms “Partition” and “Gable” are used interchangeably throughout this guide.\nNote\rKey Point: PITT units are designed for installation from underneath the countertop. When a PITT unit intersects a partition, a split partition must be fabricated.\nWarning\rCaution: Never position a PITT unit atop a permanently affixed partition.\nFabricating a Split Partition Objective: This guide provides an approach that utilizes the standard carcass unit, adjusting only where necessary to accommodate the PITT unit.\nCritical Measurement: A minimum of 150mm clearance is required from the structural low point (e.g., underneath the front support rail) of the cabinet structure. In the demonstration, the arrangement comprises three cabinets, each 900mm in width, and a PITT unit (Drum) with a width of 1200mm. Cutting Specifications: Cuts are necessary at the 150mm and 250mm marks.\nThe minimum 150mm is a guideline; adjust based on specific components like drawer runners. This ensures proper space for PITT unit installation. The two carved out sections interlock seamlessly, akin to puzzle pieces, allowing for easy reassembly when needed. Outcome: The end result is a gable/partition that is easy to disassemble and provides ample space for installation. Modifying a Pre-existing Fixed Partition If faced with an already established fixed partition, modifications are imperative.\n",

While adjusting the front adjustment screws from beneath the bench using a hand screwdriver, continuously monitor the control knob. Tighten the screws until the base of the control knob surpasses the top of the scale. Detach both the scale and the control knob, then peel off the backing from the adhesive sticker. Now, gently lower the scale back onto the benchtop, ensuring it’s as centred as possible within the knob. Remember, it’s a circle within a circle, alignment is key. Press down on the control knob and rotate it counter clockwise until it reaches the 9 o’clock position. Ensure it springs back up to its initial position effortlessly. Turn the knob from here to the 7 o’clock to 11 and back. This is helping the scale and knob align correctly. IMPORTANT. The only time the control knob should be pressed down in use is at the 9 0’clock position\nPress the scale down to make full contact. ",
